# Ali_Khatami_Lottery5(Learning from the video of Patrick Collins)

### Introduction to Chainlink keepers 

now we update our contract at https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery4.git<br>
so that it can not only pick up a verifiably random winner but it can also do <br>

this all programmatically and automatically trigger picking up of random winner based on some time interval <br>

without us having interact with it and in a deentralized contract  <br>

In order for us to automatically  trigger a smart contract based on some parameter <br>

be time parameter , maybe the price of some asset ,maybe there is some money in <br>

the liquidity pool or really whatever trigger that we want  <br>

We can use chain link keepers <br>
